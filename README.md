# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Analysis using SQL (Northwind Database)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing e-commerce business data using SQL to uncover meaningful insights that support strategic decision-making. By querying the Northwind database, I simulated real-world business scenarios such as identifying top-performing products, revenue trends, customer value, and shipping efficiency.
